**SUMMARY:**

My personal goal is to become a front-end developer. I want to learn from the best developers and mentors because it is very important for me. I donâ€™t have too much experience, but I want to improve it day after day. I studied HTML, CSS, Javascript programming languages, and also studied bootstrap framework a bit. I use MS Code IDE. At the moment I am studying at ISTU on a specialty "Infocommunication technologies, communication networks and telecommunications". I participated in language exchange programs and was engaged in independent language learning.
